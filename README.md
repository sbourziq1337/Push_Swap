# What is Push_swap:

Push_swap is a project where you sort data on a stack using a limited set of instructions and aim for the lowest possible number of moves. To succeed, youâ€™ll need to explore and implement various algorithms, choosing the most optimized solution for efficient data sorting.

### Allowed Actions:

You can manipulate two stacks with the following actions:

- **sa, sb, ss**: Swapping elements at the top of stacks.
- **ra, rb, rr**: Rotating stacks (top to bottom).
- **rra, rrb, rrr**: Reverse rotating stacks (bottom to top).
- **pa, pb**: Pushing elements from one stack to the other.

**How the actions work:**

# Which Algorithm Iâ€™ve Used?

### The Turk Algorithm

The **Turk Algorithm** is my unique, hardcoded approach to solving Push_swap. Inspired by the [Mechanical Turk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_Turk), itâ€™s not an elegant or sophisticated solution, but it works. Like the historical automaton with a human hidden inside, this algorithm gets the job done through brute force and manual logic rather than advanced optimization.

### How the Turk Algorithm Works

1. **Initial Setup**: Start with one sorted stack (descending order) and an unsorted stack.
2. **Transfer Phase**: Elements are moved from the unsorted stack to the sorted stack while maintaining the order.
3. **Sorting Phase**: Use pushes, swaps, and rotations to reorder the first stack into the desired arrangement.
4. **Circular Checks**: Integrate checks for circular sorting patterns to reduce unnecessary moves and improve efficiency.

While not the most refined solution, the Turk Algorithm is a reliable, no-frills method. Itâ€™s a testament to creativity over complexity and gets the job done!
